Year: 2021;
Concept: Just a year ago, things were so different. Corona has changed everything around us. Society has all gone as we are learning to live without them. But we have to remember that rain doesn't last forever. The development of covid-19 vaccines provided a hopeful light for all of us. I do believe that this will bring the pandemic to an end.;
