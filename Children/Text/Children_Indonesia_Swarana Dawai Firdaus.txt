Title: Miss A Picnic With Mom And Dad;
Year: 2021;
Concept: I really want to go to the Safari Park. But mother said, now it is still a pandemic, you have to wait patiently for the situation to be safe. I paint my mum and I, imagining taking a picnic to a Safari Park. My father is not in the painting because he is taking a picture of my mother and I. I can't wait to go to Safari Park, hope the pandemic will end soon.;
