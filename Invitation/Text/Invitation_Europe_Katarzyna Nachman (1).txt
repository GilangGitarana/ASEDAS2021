Title:Home;
Year:2020;
Concept:A year has passed since the pandemic. Many people's lives have changed completely. Many of us have been completely locked up in their homes. This house has become a prison. People stopped dating their loved ones for fear of contagion. Hope is for us each subsequent year when it will all be over and the house will cease to be a prison.;
