Title: Love Peace;
Year: 2018;
Concept: The work uses paper-cut art to present Taiwanese imagery and uses oriental design techniques as the overall vision. The bottle represents peace in the Chinese meaning. The content is the symbol of peace and the care of nature. The fan takes the homophonic sound* good* as the main vision. Spreading the meaning of love is the meaning of social atmosphere and goodness. Love is created by everyone and helps each other. It is what should be done now!;
