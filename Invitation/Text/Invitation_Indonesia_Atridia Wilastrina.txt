Year: 2021;
Concept: The dark fog covers the earth as a reminder that we will protect the earth with everything in it. Our earth is healing itself .. life has become filled with sadness, humans keep their distance from each other .. as if the earth rotates more slowly ... now the earth has started to heal .. life will be better and more optimistic ... dark clouds will change to become bright again.;
