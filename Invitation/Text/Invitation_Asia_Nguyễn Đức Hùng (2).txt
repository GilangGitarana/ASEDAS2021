Title: Time Of Year;
Year: 2020;
Concept: 2020 is a terrible year of the 21st century. All the countries of the world suffer from the epidemic of COVID -19. The places where the pandemic went through has left a great loss in spirit for every human being.       My country also had a period of social isolation. During that time I have also witnessed the effects of the pandemic in the world and in my own country.       As an artist I have chosen my work of art to convey my feelings and thoughts about the covid-19 epidemic. I want say to a period of total social isolation. At that time, people must fight and cope with the pandemic to regain their life, safety and community.;
