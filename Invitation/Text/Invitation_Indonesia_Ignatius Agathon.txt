Concept: My work entitled ‘We're Doing This Together’ made using digital techniques through the Adobe Illustrator. I got this artwork inspiration from the struggle of medics in the world to create a covid-19 vaccine as an antidote and control of the covid-19 virus itself. After the discovery of the vaccine, we all seemed to find hope to be free from this pandemic. For all the good of mankind, we should be willing and accept the vaccine, so that our lives in the world will be better and return to normal.;
