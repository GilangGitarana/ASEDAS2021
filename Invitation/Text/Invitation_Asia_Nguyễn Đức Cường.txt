Name: Nguyễn Đức Cường;
Country: Vietnam;
Title: Lucky Rooster;
Year: 2017;
Concept: In Vietnam, the image of animals represents human personality. Each year an animal is named to represent that year, with the meaning of bringing warmth and happiness to everyone. I have chosen the image of the Rooster with strong form and synthetic material with the desire through the image of Chicken, which shows the spirit of diligence, patience, optimism to overcome all difficulties to forming an independent country of Vietnam.;
