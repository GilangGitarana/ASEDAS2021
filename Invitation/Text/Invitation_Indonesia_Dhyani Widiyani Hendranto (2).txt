Title: The Spiritual Warfare;
Year: 2021;
Concept: Physical strength is measured by what one can carry; spiritual strength by what one can bear. I believe that spiritual strength is built on a strong belief system. By being a human of faith myself and encouraging my surroundings to have a strong belief system, I have become a person who not only developed surroundings with physical strength, but spiritual strength as well.;
