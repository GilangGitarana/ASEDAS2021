Title: World At Peace 03;
Year: 2021;
Concept: When peace seems to be out of reach Like a bird in a cage that longs to be freed; When calmness becomes too much of a struggle The way the stars and the moon try to snuggle; When tranquility is far from realityLike the sun setting in agony;For peace comes from within, from our efforts and own thinking. The world would be a much better place to live in if we would learn to understand and value each other.;
