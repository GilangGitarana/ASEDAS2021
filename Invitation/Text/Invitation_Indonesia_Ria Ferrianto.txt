Title: Healing of Me;
Year: 2021;
Concept: Hi, im Ika. This is a watercolor painting by my younger brother. He is a Cerebral Palsy disability survivor. Painting has been healing him during the tantrums in the last three years. During tantrums he usually hits the objects or people around him. While painting, he distracted it through brushes and watercolors. This work is a collage of watercolor drawings that he painted during the three days of early Ramadan.;
