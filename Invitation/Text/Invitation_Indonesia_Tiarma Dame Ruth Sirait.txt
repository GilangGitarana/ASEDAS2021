Concept: In this work, I try to present the Sanskrit puja, which is a puja of protection from disease, all distress, and the negative effects of cosmic imbalance. It is believed to protect one's life from life-ravaging shocks. The Śivâlaya Stava mantra, among others, mentions energies that keep the balance of nature. May the lotus-flowers present in our midst, so that the Nāgas may be purified by Sang Hyang Śiva;
