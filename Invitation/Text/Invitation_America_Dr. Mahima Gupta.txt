Concept: The great thing about art is that, with art it is easy to be able to express whatever I want. Being an artist I think I have a bigger voice than most of the people do because I can spread the meaning of hope through my art works. It's easy to be negative in these dark times, but please stay positive. Hope for a new beginning, new life. I have used bright colors symbolizing brighter times ahead.";
