Year: 2021;
Concept: My name is Maya.  I am a nurse.  I really like my career.  At this time with the situation we are facing the covid19 epidemic that is sweeping the world, the career of a nurse like me is desperately needed to treat and deal with patients infected with the covid19 virus.  Despite the high risk of being infected, I still carry out my responsibilities as the front line to address and help people from being infected and work hard to cure patients infected with this virus.  My hope is that this disease will disappear from our world so that we can all do daily activities such as returning to work and school safely, Do healthy activities such as recreation or sports and travel abroad to enjoy the beauty of this world.  We must work hard and work together to eradicate the spread of the virus that has made our lives difficult for so long.  this is the biggest new hope of me and all of us today.;
