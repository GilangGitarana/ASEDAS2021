Title: The Queen Who Seeks Freedom;
Year: 2021;
Concept: "The Queen Who Seeks Freedom" is my hope after the covid-19 pandemic is "freedom and life".The butterfly itself means a free and living animal,which is depicted as a queen which means beauty.Meaning that after the pandemic I want to be free from health regulations such A's keeping a distance,wearing a masker,etc.I also want to see my schoolmates again and live a beautifil life as usual.;
