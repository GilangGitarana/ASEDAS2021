Concept: A year has passed since the pandemic. Many people around the world have lost their jobs. This is a difficult time for artists. Artists are blue birds, free. They need a lot of freedom in their work. The pandemic changed everything. Artists from all over the world need help to be able to create from scratch. Help for artists is the only hope. Many of us live with the hope that they will start creating anew.;
