Year: 2021;
Concept: Corona Virus Diseases 19 has spread since the discovery of a case in Wuhan China on December 31, 2019. Within one year later, during 2020, this epidemic had turned into a Covid-19 pandemic. The whole world is feeling the impact. The economy is slowing down, mobility is limited in reach, and new behavioral changes that are more concerned with health by wearing masks and washing hands and maintaining distance are also better at home. In-person (offline) meetings are reduced and replaced by virtual encounters with minimal risk of spreading the virus. Schools, lectures, or gatherings that result in crowding are avoided and restricted. Various efforts were made during 2020 to prevent the spread of the virus from becoming more widespread.Efforts after efforts that were made little by little yielded results even though they were not optimal. The COVID-19 anti-viral vaccine has begun to be tested clinically. The mass production of antiviral vaccines will begin in the end of 2020. Both internationally and nationally, the development of the antiviral vaccine for COVID-19. 2021 can be said to be a year of new hope, when the Covid-19 antiviral vaccine begins to be distributed for use in residents. Even though it will take up to the next 2 years, later at least efforts to prevent and fortify yourself from the Corona disease attack will begin to have a bright spot. But even so, maintaining health by complying with health protocols must be carried out. Without it, vaccines cannot help completely.;
