Concept: My artwork is traditional oil painting.  From the bottom part of the arts, its water, then followed by soil and tree. Water, Tree and Soil represents mother nature. Soil represents the Land on earth. As we can see the painting wholly shows a mother nature balancing its source for both humans and animals. Humans should not overtake the source from wildlife because they too deserve to be on this earth at the same time I am trying to say humans can work to develop this earth but in a sustainable way by respecting other living organism rights on this earth. On the other hand, observing the artwork we can say that humans need to tackle problems such as food and water insecurity. In conclusion, a balanced life between wildlife, humans and mother nature can grant the future generation a new hope.;
