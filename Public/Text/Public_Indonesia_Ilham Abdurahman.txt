Concept: I just drew an illustration of a person who wishes. Most of the colors I use during my work were yellow from clothes to the background. I use yellow because yellow associate with sunshine and it represents light. It creates a feeling of hope, happiness and wisdom. The color evokes an optimistic sense of well being and natural light. And then i used a little bit of red splash that associate with this pandemic.;
