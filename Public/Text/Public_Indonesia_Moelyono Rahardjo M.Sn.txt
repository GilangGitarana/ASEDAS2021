Name: Moelyono Rahardjo, M.Sn.;
Country: Indonesia;
Title: “We Hope We Could Be Happy, But Not Really”;
Year: 2018;
Concept: Everything in digital space always leaves the obsoletes behind but keeps them forever as people forget their residues. These residues became specimens of surveillance systems. I imagined, while people were enjoying the medium, their attention sucked into the illusions from excitements of instant gratifications; fears of missing out; greediness; impulsiveness; ignorance; selfishness; and anxieties. I illustrate those illusions as slithering snakes on the body.;
