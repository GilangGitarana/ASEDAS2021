Title: Hope In Heaven;
Year: 2021;
Concept: After a year of lockdown, I’ve been through some challenges and I’ve learned a few things.A lot of people are depressed; people’s anxiety has increased, some people have lost their jobs, their families and their lives during this journey. Social media tell us that we’re helpless. Even I found myself lost some time ago.But when I could finally go out of home, I looked at the sky and there it is... flying above us as a divine messenger. It was a signal, it brought back my faith, I started believing again that there’s still hope.No matter how hard the situation is... If there’s HOPE, there will be life.;
