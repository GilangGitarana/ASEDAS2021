Concept: White symbolises a purity and new beginning. Flower gives a meaning of beautiful bloom. This piece doesn't need so many colours to be created and made from a single white fabric that transformed into a garment that has a powerful message behind it. This artwork tries to deliver a message that during these days we don't need too many words to change everything but the simple purity actions can give a new hope of change;
