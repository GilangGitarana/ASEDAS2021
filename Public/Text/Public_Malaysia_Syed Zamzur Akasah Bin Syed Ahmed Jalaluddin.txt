Concept: Being an admirer of nature, my art is created from my experiences as reflects on our (humankind’s) relationship to the natural world. Its a new hope in respecting back the nature while we (humankind’s) in lockdown , so do to natures, resting.  My work is recalling back the observation of memories, seeing how nature is always in constant service but also as a powerful entities to us. While climbing Mount Kinabalu this had become even more apparent to me and artworks referring to the checkpoints located in mount Kinabalu. The experiments with materials such as polymer clay, acrylic and paper to achieve the desired visual has bring forth a manifestation of one's own state of emotion. I believe through the means of art this has amplified my sensitivity and my passion towards nature, which also unlocked a sense of freedom.;
