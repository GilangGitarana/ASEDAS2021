Concept: Childhood trauma can lead to an adulthood spent in survival mode, afraid to plant roots, to plan for your future, to trust, to let joy in.  Trauma affects the brain, even after the child is removed from the source of the trauma. Its a blessing to shift from surviving to thriving. It is not simple but there is more than survival. New hope fell naturally into her arms like a butterfly from the sky.;
