Concept: This poster is made with the concept where school children, one of which is a junior high school student, has started going to school again. It is shown with a visualization where 2 children in junior high school uniforms are heading to the exit of the house to go to school where the outside world is luminous as a symbol of new hope, then they leave the empty house. Also shown was a mask that had been left on the table, which meant that the corona was finished and they did not need to come out with a mask again. The purpose of this poster is to show new hope from Covid, which wants to return to activities as before where school children have started schooling again, both seeking knowledge and making wonderful experiences with school friends. This work was created with vectors using Adobe Illustrator software.;
