Title: Hope In Sakura;
Year: 2021;
Concept: On this poster I depict a person who is feeling loss, adversity, and sadness. When this woman saw the cherry blossoms fall she realized that her hopes would fall in the right time and right moment. So, we don't have to worry about our future, because everything will be fine.;
