Concept: I am interested in the relation between a man and nature and in the possible attitude of a human being towards nature. Nature is understood here as the world of flora, fauna and inanimate nature. The idea of my project is inspired by the philosophy of Zen and the treatment of nature as a source of inspiration which allows to keep a distance to the things and in which the most important is to notice and appreciate the apparently insignificant matters – “insignificant” from the point of view of modern men oriented to materialistic and pragmatic values.In addition to the pure fascination of nature and the perception of seemingly inessential elements of life, a man himself plays a very important role in my work.A man is seen from the perspective of a journey in his everyday internal life which is extraordinarily different from the perspective of someone who observe “the same” from the outside. The direct, instant stimulus’ follow from the internal experience of other cultures, the contact with met people and from the contact with nature that gives me a feeling of “gazing novelty”, which is comparable to the experience of the world in someone childhood when everything is perceived as new and fascinating. One can find as a unifying element constituting the above mentioned fascination concerning nature and travels the touch of some timeless moments of the aware and fresh admiration of life which is distant from everyday superficial routine.
