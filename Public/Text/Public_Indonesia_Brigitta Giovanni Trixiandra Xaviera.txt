Title: Our Hope;
Year: 2021;
Concept: During the pandemic, many workers were laid off in order to reduce company operating costs, as a result many families were getting poorer. To get out of poverty, the government provides financial assistance for UMKM that are just starting their business. This is a big hope for the community. Hope after hope can be united with cooperation and togetherness, so that we will see new light and new hope in this pandemic.;
