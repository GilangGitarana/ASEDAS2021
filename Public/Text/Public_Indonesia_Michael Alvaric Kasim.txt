Year: 2021;
Concept: A special Shoeracks without clean ing. That's why I had the idea to make a dirt-resistant shoe rack so that we are free from viruses and are very useful in new normal conditions now, especially from the current COVID-19 virus.quipped with a UV lamp to remove existing viruses. Not only that, this shoe rack is equipped with a dimmer so that it can be turned off when not in use and create ambient for a room. Apart from being used as a shoe rack. This shoe rack is designed as a bench as well, making it easier for users to remove the footwear that is used.;
