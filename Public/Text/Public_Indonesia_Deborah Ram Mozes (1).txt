Concept: The basis of this thought that later spawned the work "Ayana Euweuh, Euweuh Teh Aya", a work that responds to the situation of the covid-19 pandemic, in which humans are faced with a third entity. The third entity is created from a paired cycle in the food chain, humans as the top in the food chain cause virus displacement, Man-Virus causes pandemics, pandemics, and the earth returns in pairs in producing a unique reality – oxygen for the earth increases. All as if to complement each other and fill each other, the invisible virus is able to fill the human lungs and as if sucking oxygen out, but the invisible virus seems to provide additional oxygen for the earth. Viruses that are living organisms when encountering humans who are also living beings produce a new identity that lifeless beings It is antagonistic dualism. Viruses that are living organisms when encountering humans who are also living beings produce a new identity that lifeless beings It is antagonistic dualism, viruses – empty (invisible) and human – the contents of pairs give birth to the reality of the divine, and man has no power whatever over the reality of this divinity. This work fully responds to pandemic conditions based on primordial paradoxical thoughts. Because even the creation of a work of art has a dualistic paradox. The condition that realizes man that he cannot resist anything that happens on the face of the earth, can only accept with all his surrender. This work is an image with a pencil on paper, then cut each shape of the image and scanned and inserted into a virtual space, resulting in video-based artwork.;
