Concept: In this work I question again about a point of view, about how the process of society sees the phenomena that occur around us directly, about how we perceive a phenomenon from different points of view, an image using a constructive projection I think can represent about how we see various kinds of phenomena with different perspectives, starting from the aspect of consuming various kinds of habits, culture, identity, custom, with different shapes and colors. Until finally about the perspective. Sometimes these aspects are unconsciously applied in everyday life and shape individual behavior. A point of view is often influenced by many factors, especially factors of each personal, experience, education, and ego.;
