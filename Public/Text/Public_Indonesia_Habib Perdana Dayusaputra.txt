Title: Castle On The Cliff;
Year: 2020;
Concept: This represents sometimes what we expect is not what we need, therefore I made the castle looks creepy, the two moons were a reference from the movie Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope in the scene where Luke looks at the sunset that marks Luke starting a new adventure;
