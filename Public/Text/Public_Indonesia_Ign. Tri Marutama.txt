Title: A New Hopes And New Habits;
Year: 2021;
Concept: Pandemics have changed various dimensions of life, these changes have also affected the way we perceive various social phenomena. By maintaining a distance, the loss of the culture of shaking hands and the use of masks in every daily activity, have made new habits that are taking place today. I hope this new habit makes us more human. This poster invites all of us to always be positive in responding to various problems for the sake of new hope for a better life.;
