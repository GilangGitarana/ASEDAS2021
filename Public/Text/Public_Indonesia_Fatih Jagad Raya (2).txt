Title: Romanticization Of Covid-19;
Year: 2021;
Concept: In this era, there is a lot of drama caused by the covid-19 outbreak, we are often annoyed that what we planned to just disappear, when this corona appears, there are many casualties which are increasing every day, the medical personnel are overwhelmed to handle it, even contracting it to death. Really hope a lot with this vaccine to reduce the covid-19 virus, maybe with efforts to have a vaccine can minimize the spread of the virus and even eliminate this corona virus, but often there are some people who make negative perceptions of the vaccine so that some people become victims of hoax incitement who think that this vaccine is bad for humans. For me the virus that is dangerous is not the virus itself, but the person who incites to create a negative stigma against some people to have prejudice against the vaccine. The impact is to underestimate the existence of this virus which could make this pandemic never end.This work responds to the current condition of Indonesia with a human object with a virus head that symbolizes that a virus is actually a group of people who have a bad idea about this pandemic which causes pros and cons due to hoax victims.;
