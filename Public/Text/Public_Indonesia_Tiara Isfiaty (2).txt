Title: The Simpicity Of Hope;
Year: 2021;
Concept: When the world pawns hope in the midst of an endless pandemic, a group of traditional people, in togetherness and the beat of a pestle hit the mortar, presenting grains of rice as the true hope that they pass on from one generation to another. Passing down the tradition is their new hope which is always renewed by the challenges of the times.;
