Concept: In this difficult situation, because of Covid-19. Forcing us to be aware of the health of ourselves and others. There needs to be an agreement to look after each other. At least we start from our neighbors, relatives, and our closest family. As in the Javanese proverb which reads "Rukun agawe santosa, crah agawe bubrah". Which means, "Living in harmony will definitely live in peace, otherwise if you always fight, you will get divorced.";
