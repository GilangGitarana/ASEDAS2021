Concept: During Covid-19, many activities have stopped or cannot be carried out. The hope in this poster is that we can move forward to carry out various activities again, such as during normal times or when Covid-19 did not exist yet. Therefore, "moving forward" is described by means of measuring the speed of a car. Where, it is divided into 2 parts, when Covid-19 and after Covid-19 is gone. On the right, there are an icon for the activity that is expected to be carried out again, such as going to the mall, traveling, shopping, etc. Meanwhile, on the left describes the time that is full of the Covid-19 virus. And the middle part there is a vaccine icon as a change barrier.;
