Title: An Eclectic Tree Of Life;
Year: 2021;
Concept: I drew the tree of life that I found on the Prambanan temple reliefs. For me the tree is a symbol of a life that is glorious, peaceful and harmonious. I draw by combining the perception of realist images, pop art, and traditional culture, as a metaphor for transcending cultural, geographic, and time boundaries. I think that today all human beings from all over should work together to achieve a world life together that is peaceful and harmonious.;
