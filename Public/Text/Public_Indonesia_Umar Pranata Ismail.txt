Title: Tolerance;
Year: 2021;
Concept: Using problems that occurred during the pandemic, where the problem was violence and neglect of pets. The violence and neglect of these animals is caused by human panic about the transmission of the Covid 19 virus through animals. And I hope that in this work we can love and be able to live side by side again with our pets.;
