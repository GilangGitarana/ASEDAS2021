Title: Scramble For Roles;
Year: 2021;
Concept: In this work I try to present something that is up for grabs, namely roles. Often in this day and age people - amidst the complexity of their respective problems - still there is always a chance to bring each other down. Various types of roles have been provided, but only certain people who manage to get these roles, of course all of this will create social gaps that can cause problems in a system. Everything will continue like that until eventually these people will realize that sharing roles is much better than fighting over roles.;
