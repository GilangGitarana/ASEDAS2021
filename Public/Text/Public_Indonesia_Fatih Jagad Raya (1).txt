Concept: Observing the meaning of an Indonesian state power, art and culture are our country's strongest weapons. Various types of traditional arts from Sabang to Meroke, such as batik, have various motive identities. If you look at the cultural history in Indonesia, there are many legacies of our ancestors such as temples, puppets, textiles, batik, for example the spread of Islam in Indonesia using the wayang media initiated by the Songo guardian, so that the wayang media can influence to embrace Islam.The concept of my work is inspired by the strong values of Indonesian art and culture, I have to maintain this heritage from my ancestors, so with the medium of texture, the batik that I use is a symbol of Indonesian strength that can be recognized throughout the world.;
