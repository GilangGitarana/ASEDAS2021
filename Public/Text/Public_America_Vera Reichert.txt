Title: The Spiral On The Surface;
Year: 2019;
Concept: For the “New Hope” exhibition I chose the spiral that symbolizes growth, transformation. In all my artworks the reference theme is WATER, focusing algae on the surface or corals under the sea.I launched a book ”The restless eye” that traces my art and my concern about water in our planet.;
