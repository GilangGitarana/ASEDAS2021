Title: Ripple In The Norm;
Year: 2021;
Concept: The water in this piece represents society's norm and the mask with cracks represents the ongoing pandemic. The first touch will cause a huge ripple as an effect on the water but as time goes on, it will die down. This is due to the surface tension that represents society's effort to flatten the curve.;
