Concept: I love to express my feelings through color and composition. My sense is what moves me to turn it into a work of art. I love to enjoy hearing the recipient about what is in my work and what he feels about it.Art has a high ability to embody the reality in which we live in various ways and methods, and this is its pleasure, as it does not have restrictions, but rather a free thought.;
