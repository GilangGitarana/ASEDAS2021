Title: The Steadfast Love Of The LORD;
Year: 2020;
Concept: Lamentations 3:22-23, the love of the LORD is new every morning, like the dew in the morning appear in leaves. my visual interpretation about this verse with the dew that i create with bottles of glycerin. the size of this photograph is 80x80cm, and if we look more close up (zoom 100%) will appear details of the freshness of the dew. i hope when people look at this photo will be reminded about love of God that brings new hope, new beginning, in every morning.;
