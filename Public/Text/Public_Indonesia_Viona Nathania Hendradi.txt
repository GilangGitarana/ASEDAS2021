Concept: Inspired by flowers bloom, just like a new hope. This pandemic hit us like a truck, we need to stop all activities and stay at home, reduce every way to touch to another people. Of course that isn't what we want, but we have to do this for survive, and for the better future. But we also can do different way to activities, to healing our self while this pandemic happened to us.;
