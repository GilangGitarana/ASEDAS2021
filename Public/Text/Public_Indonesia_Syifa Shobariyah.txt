Concept: the concept of my work is a motion picture that describes a city surrounded by viruses, then there is a woman flying a dove which symbolizes a new hope that we must believe in and live up to after the chaos of this epidemic.

Therefore, during this pandemic, we must not be discouraged and must have new hope to improve our lives and we must believe that we can live better lives by praying and trying.;
