Title: Warm Hug After A Long Day;
Year: 2020;
Concept: This work describes a mother (also a COVID-19 medic) who finally hugs her son even though death separates them. You can’t actually hug someone who already passed away, that’s why cold color tone is used to represent ‘imaginary warm hug’ that actually both can’t feel the warm of their hug.;
