Title: The Slimpicity Of Parang;
Year: 2021;
Concept: This experiment deliberately takes the essence of parang motif by taking its basic form using, specifically the sloping shape on lereng and parallelogram on mlinjon. In difficult conditions, less is more suitable in simplifying complex motifs but doesn’t remove the original characters. The Javanese hokokai concept is also applied to the two sides concept of color difference, intended as a form of production efficiency and usage efficiency.;
