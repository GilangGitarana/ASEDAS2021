Concept: The space will accommodate flexible changing various activities such as sports, ceremonies, gathering events, children playground, and so on, surrounded by trees and vegetations. YSLH concerns about environmental-based value education will be supported by the micro library that can be easily accessed by the community. The most important thing is that the space can be used daily as a gathering space where everyone can use as their meeting point. The space improvement hopefully will increase the community awareness as a new hope for a better environment as the nature and also environment as the place where human live in.;
