Title: Back To Campus;
Year: 2021;
Concept: The concept of the Artwork that I brought is a poster containing elements of A New Hope with the title Back To Campus. So in the poster depicts the outfit of students with health protocols in self-security as still in the COVID-19 pandemic and in the background that I brought is a theme titled Back To Campus. Therefore I made this work as a student I have never visited the campus and have never studied face-to-face and met other friends.;
