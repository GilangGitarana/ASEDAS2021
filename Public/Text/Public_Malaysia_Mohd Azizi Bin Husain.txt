Concept: The concept of this FIGHTCOVID19 is using 3D voxel arts which a type of art form where 3D models are constructed entirely out of 3D cubes. This artwork show the sentiment cooperation between frontliners and people fighting the covid19 virus. Using this 3D model technology, I can share virtual creations using fascinating color yet memorable and this is why I create this artwork, the incoming dangerous virus in modern world.;
