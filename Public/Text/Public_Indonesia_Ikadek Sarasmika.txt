Concept: This work tells the story of a world life filled with pieces of sorrow, where a man cannot breathe in a new life but breathe in the life that is lost. Because this man wants hope filled with the colors of the world. Likewise, the color in the growth symbolizes the color of its life. From the yellow color symbolizes the beautiful sunshine every morning and evening, blue symbolizes the beautiful again when the daytime shines and red symbolizes the courage to compose a new world, because the new world is a new beginning to change the original life that has been destroyed.;
